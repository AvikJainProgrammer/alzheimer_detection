ABSTRACT

Throughout the years, elective medication has completed various methodical investigations of the eye, proposing as a scientific help to the brain disease detection, which examines the changes of the iris in correspondence with the organs of the human body. This is the reason it presents the chance to research and find out about certain neuronal ailments, explicitly Alzheimer depends on advanced picture handling. For this, the utilization of scientific models dependent on particular programming (MATLAB), decides the qualities of the brain building up measures or examples to decide the presence or not of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer issue disease is one of the fundamental concerns of AI and picture handling. The Alzheimer recognition has the various stages named as pre-handling, division, highlight extraction and order. The strategy for Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is actualized to pull out qualities. The amalgamated technique of k-nearest neighbor and Naïve Bayes is utilized for order. The presentation is examined concerning accuracy, precision and recall. The proposed strategy is accomplished in MATLAB and end result is enhancing for Alzheimer discovery.

ONCLUSIONAlzheimer’s sickness (AD)is a progressive degenerative issue that attacks the mind nerve cellsbringing about loss of memory, thinking, language skills and social changes. Promotion is themost common sort of dementia.  The absolute cerebrum decay and explicitly hippocampal de-cay are considered as the solid demonstrative trial of AD. Endeavors are being made to analyzethese neurodegenerative issues in the beginning phases. In fact, early determination causes pa-tients to acquire the greatest treatment advantage before critical mental decrease happens.  Itis concluded that Alzheimer Malady wisdom is considerable matter of picture preparing andAI. The Alzheimer is the mind issue which is hard to recognize from the MRI pictures. In thiswork, the procedure of Alzheimer issue is proposed dependent on the KNN and Naïve Bayesstrategy. The accuracy with the proposed method is accomplished up to 94 percent

MATLAB is required to run the program
